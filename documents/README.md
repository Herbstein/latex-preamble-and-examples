# Documents
The documents folder includes _example_ documents that you can use for quick
reference on how to use a package. Then there are also _templates_ from which
you quickly can get started on your next hand-in, project report, thesis or
paper.

## Example Documents
The example documents are prefixed with `examples_` and are the following

- __article__: Shows with one or more examples how to do most things in LaTeX
  you will ever have to do as part of your Bachelor's or Master's course.

- __beamer__: Shows how LaTeX Beamer works to create slideshows, including
  animations.

## Templates
The template documents are prefixed with `template_` and are the following

- __blank__: The most bare bones template ready for writing a hand-in of a few
  pages in a course.

- __report__: For longer reports or papers. It has a more elaborate header and
  footer, bibliography, and already includes an abstract and table of contents.
  This could be used for a Bachelor's thesis, a longer project-report or as a
  simplistic template for a paper.

- __dissertation__: For longer dissertations, allowing use of chapters rather
  than only sections. This can be used for a Master's thesis or a PhD thesis.

- __beamer__: An empty LaTeX slideshow.
